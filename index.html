                As a psychotherapist, I'm grateful to Nathan Joblin for writing
                Trapped!. This material is timely, given that some of our
                culture's voices can mischaracterize the masculine as solely
                toxic, leaving many feeling misunderstood and maligned. This
                book speaks to the need for compassion, courage, and strength in
                addressing the healing and health of the masculine. Nathan
                Joblin's work is a pathway forward for men looking to shift/free
                themselves toward a new paradigm of grounding their lives in
                purpose, meaning, and love. Trapped! is a must-read to awaken
                and support the heroic masculine, a crucial and valuable part of
                the human collective.

                    We were taught to be team players and play by the rules, and
                    since we tend to do what we are told, we make sure that we
                    are good at it. And because we play the game so well, we
                    believe we should be rewarded with happiness, success, and
                    prosperity. In reality, though, nothing is promised to any
                    of us, and we do ourselves a disservice by defining success
                    in material terms. This dynamic will continue indefinitely
                    until we take responsibility for defining our own needs and
                    desires in this world.
